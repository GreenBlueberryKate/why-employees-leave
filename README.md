# 📊 Employee Attrition Isn’t Random: A Behavioral Analysis with Explainable Logistic Regression

This project explores employee attrition through a behavioral and analytical lens, combining structured exploratory data analysis (EDA) with an interpretable logistic regression model.

Rather than focusing on prediction performance, the goal is to understand *why* employees leave by identifying patterns in engagement, workplace experience, and lifestyle factors.

## 🔎 Key Focus Areas

- Behavioral Exploratory Data Analysis
- Statistical reasoning and subgroup analysis
- Feature engineering (distance bands, structural context)
- Interpretable Machine Learning (Logistic Regression)

---

## 📌 Main Insights

- Employee engagement signals (JobInvolvement, EnvironmentSatisfaction) show the strongest stabilizing effect.
- Commute distance reveals a clear gradient, with longer commutes associated with higher attrition risk.
- Department-level patterns highlight the difference between attrition **risk** (rates) and organizational **impact** (counts).

## 🛠️ Tools Used

Python · Pandas · Seaborn · Scikit-learn

## 🎯 Project Approach

EDA → Behavioral hypotheses → Interpretable modeling → Business-focused conclusions

This project reflects an analyst-style workflow where machine learning supports interpretation rather than acting as a black-box solution.
